# Welcome!

This is my website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), using the [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro) theme. I've tried a lot of different themes and frameworks for my website, and this one is the most fun to work with. It offers a nice balance of flexibility and simplicity -- easy to hack around, but sensible defaults.

This website is hosted using Cloudflare Workers. Each push triggers a new deployment.

I also use Cloudflare for DNS and domain management, as well as some of their other features (like their KV store).

You can find documentations for the Cloudflare Workers deployment [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro) and [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare).
