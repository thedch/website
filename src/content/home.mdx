👋 Hi, I'm Daniel — a machine learning engineer focused on the intersection of research and product.

I'm currently at xAI, working to advance state-of-the-art AI systems.

I've spent time in both the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing domains, most recently as the Head of AI Engineering at Harvey AI.
Before that, I did Computer Vision Research at Tesla on the Autopilot team, helping build and ship Full Self Driving.
You can see more of my work [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thedch).

This website exists for three main reasons:

### 1️⃣ A representation of my career and resume

If you're here to understand who I am and what I've worked on — welcome!
You can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf).

### 2️⃣ A home for my writing

I write to clarify my thinking. Publishing publicly forces rigor, encourages better reasoning, and lets me share what I wish I knew years ago.

Topics include:

- product development and engineering challenges
- psychology of building great products
- scaling startups and org design
- modern ML research and practical implementation work

I write in a build-in-public style — some posts polished, some exploratory.

### 3️⃣ A sandbox for experimentation

As software approaches zero marginal cost, the pipeline from idea → prototype → live on the internet has never been easier. Thinking of the browser as _“a way to let other people run my code instantly”_ makes tinkering fun.

Not everything here is production-grade — some things are just experiments. Recently I've been exploring local-first LLM inference, WebGPU acceleration, and running small models directly in the browser.
