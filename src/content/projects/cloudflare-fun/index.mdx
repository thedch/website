Cloudflare has a rich ecosystem, and I've been wanting to try it out a bit.
Beyond their CDN / DDoS protection, they have a lot of interesting products --
a KV store, structured database, AI inference systems, and more.

For example, here's a simple global state represented by a 25 length string.
Each cell can be in one of three states, determined by the value of the character
at that index.

This is backed by the Cloudflare KV store, and the state is managed by a simple
React component. You can click on any cell to transition it to the next state,
and the changes are persisted to the KV store. If you refresh the page, you'll
see that the state is persisted (or check this website on a different device).
