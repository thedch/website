Text embeddings are dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning
of words and sentences. By mapping similar concepts to nearby points in high-dimensional
space, they enable machines to understand relationships between different pieces of text.

This interactive visualization uses state-of-the-art transformer models to generate
embeddings from your text, then applies UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection) to reduce the dimensionality down to 3D space while preserving the
semantic relationships.

**How it works:**
- ü§ñ **AI-powered embeddings**: Uses HuggingFace's `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` transformer model to convert text into 384-dimensional vectors
- üìê **Dimensionality reduction**: UMAP algorithm intelligently compresses embeddings to 3D while maintaining semantic clustering
- üéÆ **Interactive 3D space**: Navigate the embedding space with mouse controls - drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
- üîç **Semantic exploration**: Texts with similar meanings appear closer together in the 3D space

Try adding your own texts to see how different concepts cluster together. You might
discover interesting semantic relationships that weren't immediately obvious!
