            <p>
              ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a machine learning engineer with an emphasis on
              the intersection of research and product.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've spent time in both the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing domains,
              most recently as the <a href="https://www.harvey.ai">Head of AI Engineering at Harvey AI</a>.
              Before that, I did Computer Vision Research at Tesla on the Autopilot team, helping build and
              ship Full Self Driving. You can see more of my work <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thedch">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website exists for three main reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, as a representation of my career and resume.
              If you came hoping to understand who I am and what I've worked on, welcome!
              You can find a friend About Me + resume below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, as a public repository of my writing. I am a strong believer in
              using writing to solidify my thinking and building clarity by forcing myself to
              formulate ideas onto paper. Doing this in public is an extra forcing function to
              be rigorous in my thinking, so I try to do it when time permits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly, as a sandbox to tinker with things I'm interested in. As the cost of software drops to zero,
              the pipeline of idea â†’ software prototype â†’ ship to the internet is increasingly low friction. If you hold the rough mental
              model of a web browser as "a way to let other people easily run the code I write", this makes tinkering lots of fun!
              More-or-less anything that doesn't require authentication or heavy compute processing can be written as a client-only
              application, aka a static site. I'm not a web deverloper by trade, so

              These sorts of small utilities are often pointless or redundant from a revenue generating or unique IP perspective, but are usually written with some interesting artistic perspective in mind, or specific use case that I personally care about.
            </p>
            <p>
              I write primarily about interesting product development and engineering challenges.
              The psychology of building a great product, the organizational challenges of scaling startups,
              the latest research in ML, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tend to write in a build-in-public style, so some of my posts are more polished than others.
              I try to share my learnings as I go, writing what I wish I knew years ago.
